# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Student Entrollment System.
# SRS (Procedure):

1. Study and understand the requirements of the student enrollment system
2. Identify the users or actors like student, admin, registrar, faculty
3. List the main functions such as student registration, course selection, fee payment, enrollment confirmation
4. Identify main objects or classes like Student, Course, Enrollment, Payment, Admin
5. Define the relationships and interactions among system components
6. Create the workflow or process flow for operations like course enrollment and registration
7. Organize the system structure and represent it using UML diagrams
